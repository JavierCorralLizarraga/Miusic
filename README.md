# Miusic
Music from code :)

Roadmap:
1. Get sample audio files
2. Get familiar with libraries for their reproduction
3. Manipulate the files to create filters 
4. Create audio files from scratch (np arrays)
5. Get familiar with periodic functions
6. Get a live coding environment to experiment
7. Create a set of sounds on a scale to import and use with a MIDI
